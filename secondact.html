        <div class="PeterStockmann"><h6>Peter Stockmann.</h6></div> <p>Quite so, quite so. I don't blame him in the least, as
a writer, for addressing himself to the quarters where he will find the
readiest sympathy. And, besides that, I personally have no reason to
bear any ill will to your paper, Mr. Hovstad.</p>

<div class="hovstad"><h6>Hovstad</h6></div><p>
. I quite agree with you.</p>

<div class="PeterStockmann"><h6>Peter Stockmann.</h6></div> <p>Taking one thing with another, there is an excellent
spirit of toleration in the town—an admirable municipal spirit. And it
all springs from the fact of our having a great common interest to
unite us—an interest that is in an equally high degree the concern of
every right-minded citizen.</p>

<div class="hovstad"><h6>Hovstad</h6></div><p>
<p>Baths, yes.</p>

<div class="PeterStockmann"><h6>Peter Stockmann.</h6></div> <p>Exactly—-our fine, new, handsome Baths. Mark my
words, Mr. Hovstad—the Baths will become the focus of our municipal
life! Not a doubt of it!</p>

<div class="Mrs Stockmann"><h6>Mrs. Stockmann.</h6></div><p>That is just what Thomas says.</p>

<div class="PeterStockmann"><h6>Peter Stockmann.</h6></div> <p>Think how extraordinarily the place has developed
within the last year or two! Money has been flowing in, and there is
some life and some business doing in the town. Houses and landed
property are rising in value every day.</p>

<div class="hovstad"><h6>Hovstad</h6></div><p>
. And unemployment is diminishing,</p>

<div class="PeterStockmann"><h6>Peter Stockmann.</h6></div> <p>Yes, that is another thing. The burden on the poor
rates has been lightened, to the great relief of the propertied
classes; and that relief will be even greater if only we get a really
good summer this year, and lots of visitors—plenty of invalids, who
will make the Baths talked about.</p>

<div class="hovstad"><h6>Hovstad</h6></div><p>
. And there is a good prospect of that, I hear.</p>

<div class="PeterStockmann"><h6>Peter Stockmann.</h6></div> <p>It looks very promising. Inquiries about apartments
and that sort of thing are reaching us, every day.</p>

<div class="hovstad"><h6>Hovstad</h6></div><p>
. Well, the doctor's article will come in very suitably.</p>
