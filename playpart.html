            <p>My husband makes such a point of having his meals punctually, you know.

Billing. That doesn't affect me a bit. Indeed, I almost think I enjoy a
meal all the better when I can sit down and eat all by myself, and
undisturbed.</p>

<div class="Mrs Stockmann"><h6>Mrs.Stockmann.</h6></div>
 <p>Oh well, as long as you are enjoying it—. <p>(Turns to
the hall door, listening.)</p> I expect that is Mr. Hovstad coming too.

Billing. Very likely.</p>

<p>(PETER STOCKMANN comes in. He wears an overcoat and his official hat,
and carries a stick.)</p>

<div class="PeterStockmann"><h6>Peter Stockmann.</h6></div>
 <p>Good evening, Katherine.</p>

 <div class="Mrs Stockmann"><h6>Mrs. Stockmann</h6></div>
<p>(coming forward into the sitting-room).</p> <p>Ah, good
evening—is it you? How good of you to come up and see us!</p>

<div class="PeterStockmann"><h6>Peter Stockmann.</h6></div>
 <p>I happened to be passing, and so— <p>(looks into the
dining-room).</p>But you have company with you, I see.</p>

<div class="Mrs Stockmann"><h6>Mrs. Stockmann</h6></div>
 <p>(a little embarrassed).</p> <p>Oh, no—it was quite by chance
he came in. <p>(Hurriedly.)</p>Won't you come in and have something, too?</p>

<div class="PeterStockmann"><h6>Peter Stockmann.</h6></div>
 <p>I! No, thank you. Good gracious—hot meat at night!
Not with my digestion.</p>

<div class="Mrs Stockmann"><h6>Mrs. Stockmann.</h6></div>
 <p>Oh, but just once in a way—</p>

 <div class="PeterStockmann"><h6>Peter Stockmann.</h6></div>
     <p>No, no, my dear lady; I stick to my tea and bread and
butter. It is much more wholesome in the long run—and a little more
economical, too.</p>

<div class="Mrs Stockmann"><h6>Mrs. Stockmann</h6></div>
 <p>(smiling).</p> <p>Now you mustn't think that Thomas and I are
spendthrifts.</p>

<div class="PeterStockmann"><h6>Peter Stockmann.</h6></div>
<p>Not you, my dear; I would never think that of you.
<p>(Points to the Doctor's study.)</p> Is he not at home?</p>

<div class="Mrs Stockmann"><h6>Mrs. Stockmann.</h6></div>
 <p>No, he went out for a little turn after supper—he and
the boys.</p>

<div class="PeterStockmann"><h6>Peter Stockmann.</h6> </div>
<p>I doubt if that is a wise thing to do. <p>(Listens.)</p> I
fancy I hear him coming now.</p>

<div class="Mrs Stockmann"><h6>Mrs. Stockmann</h6></div>
 <p>No, I don't think it is he. <p>(A knock is heard at the
door.)</p> Come in! <p>(HOVSTAD comes in from the hall.)</p> 

<div class="Mrs Stockmann"><h6>Mrs. Stockmann</h6></div>
<p>(to HOVSTAD).</p> <p>But won't you—?</p> <p>(Points to the
dining-room.)</p>
